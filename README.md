# **Berlin Covid-19 Dashboard**

This project is an interactive dashboard that visualizes the COVID-19 situation in Berlin using official data obtained from the Berlin State Office for Health and Social Affairs (LAGeSo). The dashboard provides up-to-date insights into key indicators such as daily and cumulative case numbers, recoveries, hospitalizations, testing rates, and district-level trends.

The data is sourced directly from LAGeSoâ€™s official reports and parsed into a user-friendly format for visualization. No machine learning models are used in this project; the focus is on clear, accurate, and accessible representation of real-time data. This ensures transparency and reliability for users seeking to understand the development of the pandemic in Berlin.

The project aims to support public awareness and local decision-making by making health data easy to interpret for both professionals and the general public.
